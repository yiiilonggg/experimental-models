    "### Variational AutoEncoder Chess Position Generator\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Inspiration\n",
    "* Recently, I have been reading up about generative models, and one of them that caught my eye was the VAE.\n",
    "* It allows you to generate new data that is similar to your training data.\n",
    "* At the same time, I am interested in chess and have enjoyed solving chess puzzles for quite awhile.\n",
    "* However, the premise of a chess puzzle is that the player knows that there exists a optimal move / sequence of moves that provides the player an advantage.\n",
    "* This helps the player to improve in terms of tactics and pattern recognition, but in most cases when playing a game of chess, we do not know if there exists an optimal solution.\n",
    "* This introduces the idea of an anti-puzzle, where the premise is now that the chess position provided may have an optimal solution, or the \"solution\" is to play a move that maintains the status-quo.\n",
    "* With the VAE, we can train it with a training set of legal chess positions, and have it output more chess positions.\n",
    "* Since the VAE would not have any idea if the chess position has an optimal solution or not, it is perfect for creating \"anti-puzzle\" solutions.\n",
    "* Furthermore, chess is a \"constrained\" game, where the rules are clear and we can check if the position generated by the VAE is a legal position or not.\n",
    "* For this model, the goal is to simply generate new (legal) chess positions."

    "##### Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "* The easiest way to obtain chess is positions is from my own games.\n",
    "* I exported move data from some chess games that I have played online in Lichess, which comes in a .pgn file.\n",
    "* From this file, we can get the move orders for the games that I have exported, from which I can deduce the chess positions.\n",
    "* For this, I used the python-chess library, which helps to deduce FEN positions from PGN move list\n",
    "* Once we get the FEN positions, we can derive the values for the input data we wish to parse into our model\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data Representation\n",
    "* Although this doesn't give the chess positions directly, we can manipulate it into a form that works for the VAE.\n",
    "* The current idea is to have a 8 x 8 x 12 matrix, which means to say each of the 12 pieces (K, Q, R, B, N, P, k, q, r, b, n, p) each have their own 8 x 8 chessboard that denotes their position.\n",
    "* We can generate these as all chess games I exported start from the standard position, and we can denote the piece at a certain position with a 1 (i.e. 0 marks that the piece is not at that position).\n",
    "* This coincidentally is a perfect data set for generating anti-puzzles as it is formed from the sequence of moves of a game, of which not all positions have an optimal solution."
